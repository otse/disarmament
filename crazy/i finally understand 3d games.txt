vr works for me, where 3d games don't

now i just need to understand vr players

the game will have several areas

first you start at the "tunnels" which has small admin areas

the first level is rather soviet looking, and dubbed soviet-gen for this purpose

but why? will my brain provide answers?

stylistically this is murder

the facility is a toxic decommissioning site sitting on a garbage moon

the player is forced to land here
