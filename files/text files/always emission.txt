for this setting idea, the outside is always stuck in an endless emission, that means a violent red sky that hurts your nervous system and kills you

however there are reprieves from the endless tunnels;

you take staircases or ladders up, into boarded-up warehouses and other industrial buildings

to sum it up:
- the outside is emission
- the labyrinthine of bunkers and tunnels are there, don't ask why
- the reprieve that i mentioned, you go up and experience sunlight, beautiful warehouses and actual architecture
- however you can't go outside, that's just the backdrop
- i can model small patches of outside, like when you're in a barn, you can see the background, will have to think that one through
- there's that red hue from emission, then there's sun, lighting storms, and radiation
- it's nondescript generic outside violence
- fashion is a blend of the leathery suits from stalker, and the military attire from metro
- there *can be* anomalies, artefacts, since this is a stalker inspired setting, not a metro inspired setting
- this setting is relatively silly and indie, and practically it's easier to only do "tunnels and warehouses"
- gas masks, protective suits, drugs, food and the like are all important

however:
- what is the point of anything when the world itself is stuck in a continual atomic blast?
- that's bleak even for an indie setting, it's very joyless
- if this is a soviet bunker world, it's limited to concrete, yellow lamps, and cots
