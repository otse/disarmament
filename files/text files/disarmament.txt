i tried to do something intelligent for garbage

following real infrastructure and cause for war

but as a video game it doesn't need to "follow logic"

you just need a room with a guitar, a shotgun and a gas mask

corridors with piping, valves and fuse boxes

garbage has themes of shit and themes of beauty in shit

take eye divine which i consider the coolest game ever

it taught me to be strong in a world of shit where shit is the norm

as far as garbage is considered you wade through shit

i firmly belief themes of shit

disarmament is the continuation of garbage but with real world infrastructure

instead of a retro future garbage moon these are bunkers, service tunnels and real world infrastructure

disarmament doesn't convene you, ahem doesn't do convenience. there is no hand-holding. if you can't find a shell for your break-action you will need to look harder! because armed guys are coming through that linear section. the best thing you can do at this point is hide. you are a rat. not a hero.

disarmament is poorly explained. it has themes of attrition and of war. there is talk of an ignited atmosphere. it explains things through idfk and philosophy. what has really happened is not very concrete anymore.
