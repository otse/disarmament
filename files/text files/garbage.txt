garbage is the old idea that the world is trash nothing more nothing less

the surface is "unvisitable"

although a large man hole to the surface ending within a factory could exist

right now the workflow is good, but the creativity is lacking

compiling the ideas are like wading through shit

the idea for garbage came from salvage and then it was that i noticed i hated retro future

i went back to a more sombre theme of realness and garbage became disarmament

for the new jacket i follow more real infrastructure
