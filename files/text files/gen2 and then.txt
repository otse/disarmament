say and then again

the starting level uses environmental storytelling to tell the story of squatters who left in a hurry. players start in a partly collapsed sewer and are led through a maintenance tunnel turned into a base which is now abandoned. besides exposed tubing, valves and fuse boxes, there will be beds, an admin area and more. because of the sewer the place is wet, slippery and "moldy".

first staircase:
up the staircase there is an abandoned bunker

idea: when you walk into the bunker you are welcomed by a faulty shotgun trap

idea: instead of toxic mushrooms, spores or growths there is nature

forget toxic tunnels. the setting of the game is underground during an unknown time. garbage is poorly explained. it is not the future stuck in retro future. mankind didn't perish. the way to the surface eludes.

garbage is set during an unknown time. it is likely set somwhere in america.

the trick is to keep it simple fun, a relaxed yet tense atmosphere of survival

why put on a headset just to be stuck in a world of shit...
