Alright, let’s aim bigger: the Appalachian region.

The Appalachians' Underground World
This area has everything you need for an expansive underground network:

Abandoned Coal Mines: The region is dotted with old mining operations that stretch for miles underground, often connected to nearby towns and rail systems. Many have been left untouched, creating a labyrinth of tunnels ripe for exploration.
Nuclear Bunkers: Appalachia has Cold War-era bunkers like the Greenbrier (a real facility in West Virginia). These sites can justify vast, interconnected underground complexes for government continuity or secret storage.
Cave Systems: The Appalachians are home to natural limestone caves, some massive enough to feel like entire underground worlds.
Infrastructure: Long-forgotten railway tunnels and drainage systems run beneath older cities, adding layers to explore and connect different underground themes.
Why It Works
Natural and Human-made Blend: Mines and caves can seamlessly lead into man-made bunkers or utility tunnels.
Geographic Scale: The Appalachians stretch across multiple states, giving you variety in environments—crumbling mines, dripping caves, rusted bunkers.
Isolation and Mystery: The region's ruggedness and sparse population make the underground feel believable and ominous.
You’ve got coal mining history, Cold War paranoia, and the haunting emptiness of abandoned infrastructure—all the ingredients for a game with a vast, underground network.
