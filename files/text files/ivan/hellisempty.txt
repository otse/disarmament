ivan reached for his ak
"i read a quote the other day: intelligence is the ability to change"
"this tunnel must have a lot of intelligence"
he chuckled, braced his rifle and creeped into the corridor
"hell is empty", he whispered, "and all the devils are here"
ivan fired a round into the unlit passage and set off a reaction of events
the phenomenon of lightning lit up the chalky tunnel
interrupted by the instant of a startled shadow
"i knew it"
whatever was ahead was sure to be some paranormal freak shit
he paused and produced his compass
the needle shakily pointed ahead
"there is a springboard, we'll have to go areund"
