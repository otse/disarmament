fallout 4 has an extensive junk breakdown system that feels unintuitive

i won't remember that a baseball contains two cork and one leather

so i can patch up my armor or make a bomb out of it?

far cry new dawn only has scrap, duct tape and circuit boards

scrapping junk for components fits the fallout theme

it gives all the items in the game a purpose

but junk and scrapping is also tedious and quite random
