garbage is the old idea that the world is trash nothing more nothing less

the surface is "unvisitable"

although a large man hole to the surface ending within a factory could exist

compiling the ideas are like wading through shit

i noticed i hated retro future and salvage became garbage

then i went back to a more realness and garbage became disarmament

salvage was the retro future theme set on a garbage moon

garbage is the idea for an indie game with a garbage punk theme

disarmament is the operatives theme set during the cold war
