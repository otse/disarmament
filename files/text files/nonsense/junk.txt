fallout 4 has an extensive junk breakdown system that feels unintuitive

i won't remember that a baseball contains two cork and one leather

so i can patch up my armor or make a bomb out of it?

far cry new dawn only has scrap, duct tape and circuit boards

scrapping junk for components fits the fallout theme

it gives all the items in the game a purpose

but this collect junk, scrap into components system can feel super tedious

for the poorly explained disarmament game it makes more sense to have items like

highly soap concentrate 
some old ciruitry
dunce! tape
food canned
water bottled
