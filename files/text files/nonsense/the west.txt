far cry 5 has hope county a fictional place

perfect for far cry but not for stalker settings

rural patriotism, deep roots in family, community and country

instead of an american appalachian setting i want a more "the west" setting

western underground setting instead of general appalachia or nevada

i think american patriotism would be too much for this project
