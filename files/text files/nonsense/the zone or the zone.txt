stalker has an honesty problem
by saying that the game is based on roadside picnic they are lying
stalker shadow of chornobyl apparently takes inspiration from both the book roadside picnic and the film stalker which is based on that book
that seems legit but
in roadside picnic, stalkers are people that trespass into the zone to steal its artifacts
but there's a dumb colloquial problem
there are two zones
you have the exclusion zone of chornobyl and "the zone" from the book
at this point this coincidence just makes the merging of the two sound dumb
