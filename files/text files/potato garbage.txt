based on garb√°ge - dystopia

this setting has players skulking in the sewer of a dystopian world

players navigate the eerie, darkened world of service tunnels

most of the city that you're in has turned into a transportation network of pipes and cables

carrying resources to the vast industrial complex that you may never see up close

you're on the run for potato scanners that scan the so called sewer world

there are temporary reprieves and smaller service tunnels along the larger service tunnels

there are hideouts where you can rest and gear up before heading out into the tunnels

your clothes are half ragged and you have some tactical gear, pouches and equipment.

in a sense this is an over-the-top half-life theme focussed on a more matrix appearance

your ultimate goal is to exist in a hostile world,

but in order to unlock credits that you can spend on secret tech, you need to hack

into exposed interfaces in the smaller substations that comprise the underworld, which is dangerous

besides hacking interfaces, you have to hack sector doors to continue into the next set of tunnels,

or find a way around using smaller toxic and corrupt service tunnels
