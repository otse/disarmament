what do searchers do? they search for the source of something. but it gives the unexplained underground setting a serious twist that may be too weighty for its simple style.

what i simply want from this game is to be a game where you survive in tunnels, bunkers and forgotten infrastructure.

giving the game a silly stalker theme may kill its basic premise of being a sewer rat with a barely working rifle.

the problem right now is that the game is underlit, depressing and super bleak. tunnels are three textures, wall, floor and ceiling. i add some flaky paint and call it a tunnel. what even is level design when you can just make one dimensional tunnels.

this isn't doom. levels aren't a collection of cones, pillars and random sci-fi rooms.

can i return to the sewer world theme or find a way to make levels linear like in the half-life series? just currently the simple tunnel aesthethic is frankly killing disarmament.
