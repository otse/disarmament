look, said ivan, an anomaly!
you slowly approach the supernatural occurence as it pulsates
how does it keep going? you ask
i don't know! whispers ivan
the smalltalk stops before it begins and ivan gestures to follow
as you both set to creep into a sideroom that continues along the darkened corridor the electricity whines, zaps a nearby locker and catches fire
you dive for cover and ivan dashes behind the door which begins to fall of its hinges and ivan has to dive as well
cheyka-blegh, whispers ivan as he gets back up
old dust gets dispersed and ivan puts up his mask with one swift motion
masks!, he whispers through the cartridge
