gen2: the introductory bunker that the player escapes. flickering lights. elevation. piles of rubble. reclamation.

"where are we?"
"i don't know"

deployment: at the edge of the level
format: coop or solo
enemies: zombies, traps, anomalies
loot: artefacts?
problem: too much like stalker

alternate less supernatural setting:
its the cold war. you need to retrieve soviet intel from a bunker.

unexplained setting with caches:
the question where you are is unanswered. you are in a bunker. with tunnels.

kyshtym:
the idea is an exclusion zone that has catched the interests of adventurers. 

travel based system with local instances:
using a map you travel to levels. levels have multiple extractions from which players may come.
this is not a theme, just a way to avoid making and modeling an open world game.
the good is that you can do preplanning in a little room.
the bad is that most vr games already have this system of deployment.

mountain cache:
you approach an old cache in a mountain

here's a story for my kyshtym disaster:

where would soviet and american operators go?
why would they protect ussr secrets in abandoned locations
how would they know of american insurgents
nothing here adds up

it makes more sense to have a shady culture of operators
fighting for ussr and america

while talking to gpt about a "dumb tunnel game":
the objective could be to retrieve or defend soviet era intel or experiments
