idea one

the year is [?]. earth has messed up.

natural disasters, harmful solar radiation and biological war have ravaged the earth.

a preppers society funded by billionares have dug into the earths mantle,

creating a vast new place for humans.

as humanity died out on the surface, they lived in prosperity for a while,
enjoying the amenities of their live sewer.

fast forward and this new world has swamped. it just seems all places turn to shit eventually.
this viable underground has just become a sewer. a mockery of fate.

but there were other such places, interconnected via ginormous tunnels well adapted to
handle the deluge of shit. however the fate of these places is unknown.

(this story is an excuse for rubbish boring level design)

<=====
story two

the year is 3000. the earth is polluted. temperature has risen, and rain is now acid.

as a response humans went far underground counting on the natural filtration of dirt
and special treatment plants to create a new place of life.

<=====
story there

you're consigned to a degenerate sewer planet and you need to find scrap to repair your ship

once arrived you learn of a culture of degenerate scrappers much like the stalkers of the zone

there is a vending machine serving wrack!

corridors are concrete and metal and sometimes sci-fi(!), to show that this is not earth

lockers, bunker corridor

<====

you are on a desolate rock on a salvage yard. but the computer there makes you believe that you are
on a sewer planet, a vast world dedicated to the harvest and deconstruction of decomissioned space craft
and machines of war.

<====

blobs have runover the yard.

youve arrived at a mishmash of garbages.
