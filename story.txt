idea one

the year is [?]. earth has messed up.

natural disasters, harmful solar radiation and biological war have ravaged the earth.

gratuitously a secret preppers society funded by a billionare have dug into the earths mantle.

a vast network of facilities, hab blocks and rejuvenation plants were built to sustain select human life.

but everything became sludgy fast. entire sections became noxious and gaseous, and need special equipment
to survive there.

problem with this story: i can hardly incorporate the disrepair of civilization into this idea.
